If you work with the source code make sure to keep the style consistent.

Spaces
---
Use spaces, loops should look like this: for (int i = 0; i < 42; i++), _not:_ for(int i=0;i<42;i++).

The same goes for variables: int i = 42; *not:* int i=42;


Variable declaration
---
Declaration of multiple variables in one line is fine, but only where it makes sense.

Example: int x, y, width, height;

Braces
---

Braces should look like this:

public void test() {

}

That's pretty much it. Than you for contributing!
