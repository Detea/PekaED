## Note: This version will be replaced by a better written and designed version, this year (2020). ##
This projects code is really messy and badly designed, this repo will (if it does) stay online for archival purposes only.

If you want to work on PekaED, or compile it yourself, you need to run it with the following VM argument:

	-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true
	
This is because the drawing of the background image(s) is rather inefficient.
